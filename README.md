# 1brc in Swift

Original repo: https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/

This is an attempt to implement this challenge in Swift. I took the original requirements & test data, and 
tried to make it run in reasonable time.

Currently, I am a bit violating rule of rounding data, since I do not keep all the points.

Right now processes in ~10s by using all the cores to parallelize work.
